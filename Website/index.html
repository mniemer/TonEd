                        What is our work about?
                    </h2>
                    <p>     The goal of our project is to provide a tool that can be used to classify violin tone as either full, thin or crunchy. This tool will be useful for people who wish to improve their tone but may not have access to a trained instructor who would be able to identify the problems influencing the tone of their notes. There are several music learning programs commercially available, most notably Smart Music, that allow students to record themselves playing and then give feedback on tempo and note accuracy, but these programs fail to identify tone deficiencies well, which is the specific niche our project fills. Tone deficiencies can greatly affect the quality of music played from a violin, because although the pitch and tempo may be right, a thin or crunchy tone can cause even the most beautiful music to sound extremely unpleasant, and we hope our project can improve music learning software through tone identification.</p>
                    <p> Our project works as a simple nearest neighbor classifier, given an input recording of a scale played on violin at 100 beats per minute, the recording is classified in one of three categories, thin, crunchy or full tone. Using this feedback, the student can then hopefully improve the quality of their music after having identified the errors causing them to play with incorrect tone. The classifier is generated by a set of recordings from six experienced violinists with good tone control, who each provided a crunchy, thin and full toned sample. Each of these recordings is broken down on a note by note basis, and subsequently the MFCCs of each of these notes is calculated and broken down into a feature vector, which is subsequently used to train the nearest neighbor classifier. Each recording contains 29 notes, thus the model is trained on 522 total data points. We used several different testing methods to measure the success of our classifier, including leave one out cross validation and ten fold cross validation. We measured the success of our classifier using the precision value of the results, and we used a confusion matrix as well to analyze classification results. </p>
